# Jumbo-Ecommerce-Store-Sales-Analysis-Forecasting
Jumbo is a one-stop online shop for all your Fashion and High-Tech needs in the United States. They offer a wide selection of products including Men &amp; Women's Fashion, Mobile Phones, Computers, Electronics, Home Appliances and more, delivered straight to doorstep.

The dataset comprises online sales transactions in the United States. With a significant portion of the population now having internet access, the trend towards online shopping has accelerated, leading large retailers to actively seek out methods to increase profits.

Sales analysis is a crucial technique employed by these retailers to drive sales growth by gaining insights into customers' purchasing
behaviors and patterns.

The executive team recognizes the importance of obtaining a deeper understanding of their customers, including who they are, where they are located, what they purchase, and which payment platform they use when placing orders.

As a data scientist, I was tasked with developing a sales business dashboard that provides a comprehensive regional overview of the company's operations and include sales forecast.

This analysis and forecasting was done using Tableau.
